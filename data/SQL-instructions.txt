What is SQL?
SQL, or structured query language, is a way we can access information from databases. Databases are where big amounts of information is stored. Think about how a school might store information on all their students - they might have databases to keep track of students addresses, contact information, grades, which classes they’re enrolled in, and more!
What’s possible with SQL? With SQL, you can:
- Ask questions (or as professionals call them, queries)
    Ex: “Show me all the students who got an A”
- Add new information
    Ex: “Add a new student to our database”
- Change information
    Ex: “Update a student’s home address”
- Delete information
    Ex: “Remove student records of those who have graduated”

What can SQL do?
SQL has many uses, which inlcude executing queries against databases; retrieving data from databases; inserting, updating, and deleting database records; creating new databases, tables, and views; and set permissions.

I am capable of executing SQL commands from my interface. You can achieve this by typing "/sql"

To view the rows of a table, use the "select" command, please ask more questions about the "select" command.
    - Use the "select <columnName> from <databaseName>.<tableName>;
To view the columns, use the "show command" command. If you are unsure, I am here to help.

How can I view the contents of a database? 
Use the "show tables in databasename" command

Databases and Tables
Database: collection of organized data. 
Tables: containers for data in a database. Excel sheets in a file.
