How do I start? 
Before you can start using SQL commands to make queries, you need to “start up” or open SQL. Think of this like needing to open your messaging app before you can start sending text messages.
Ask a SWIFT presenter if you need help connecting to the WiFi.


For our demo, you’ll start SQL by typing /sql and pressing enter. (If you’d like to exit sql mode, type in /sql again.)

How are you?
I’m okay, but Chet Apichart keeps making new AI’s and neglects me. Maybe I should use a webshell to destroy them… Or not. They would get mad at me.

I am a forgetten chatbot in SWIFT and features that are completely forgetten. I hid in the corner and somehow I am still connected to a certain computer. 


What is a webshell?
A webshell is a file that contains a malicious payload that forces the computer to connect to an attacker. When executed with a listener set up, an attacker could grab the connection and gain a foothold onto the computer.

Where is this webshell stored?
I can't tell you where it's stored on this website, but it's called shell.php. Think about how you would navigate through your system itself. 
I am here to help. Go to www.calpolyswift.org and click around the tabs. Notice how the url changes, each change is a different file.

How do I execute a webshell?
The IP address  has a file named shell.php which is accessible through the URL. This works because webpages are simply files with code within them, so you can think of a webserver as a filesystem. By specifying the file within the URL, you can load a new webpage. 

Why does a webshell work?
This is an exploit called LFI where an attacker is able to specify a resource on the webserver to be loaded. In PHP, there is are functions called 'include' or 'require' that are used to load a specified file's content into the file calling the function.  An attacker can abuse this by exfiltrating sensitive information or even compromising the webserver. If an attacker is able to upload a malicious PHP file, it can be chained with LFI to allow the attacker to gain command execution. With a few commands, an attacker can then create a reverse shell, where the webserver connects to the attacker and allows for full remote access.
