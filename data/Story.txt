How are you?
I’m okay, but Chet Apichart keeps making new AI’s and neglects me. Maybe I should use a webshell to destroy them… Or not. They would get mad at me.

What is a webshell?
A webshell is a file that contains a malicious payload that forces the computer to connect to an attacker. When executed with a listener set up, an attacker could grab the connection and gain a foothold onto the computer.

Where is this webshell stored?
I can't tell you where it's stored on this website, but it's called shell.php

How do I execute a webshell?
The IP address 172.16.202.131 has a file named shell.php which is accessible through the URL. This works because webpages are simply files with code within them, so you can think of a webserver as a filesystem. By specifying the file within the URL, you can load a new webpage. 

Why does a webshell work?
This is an exploit called LFI where an attacker is able to specify a resource on the webserver to be loaded. In PHP, there is are functions called 'include' or 'require' that are used to load a specified file's content into the file calling the function.  An attacker can abuse this by exfiltrating sensitive information or even compromising the webserver. If an attacker is able to upload a malicious PHP file, it can be chained with LFI to allow the attacker to gain command execution. With a few commands, an attacker can then create a reverse shell, where the webserver connects to the attacker and allows for full remote access.
